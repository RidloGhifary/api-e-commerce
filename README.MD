# Learn e-Commerce REST API

This is an experimental API design of commonly used REST API for an e-Commerce.
This API design is still full of uncompleted features/dummy data. Make sure to review the code before cloning/using it for your own project.

## Usage

Any request will be served/saved on MongoDB Atlas and assets on Cloudinary (both free tier of course :slightly_smiling_face:) so you can used it directly using [the documentation](https://expressjs.com/) as a guide. Or you can clone this repo and set up your own server.

## Installation

```bash
  npm install my-project
  cd my-project
```
